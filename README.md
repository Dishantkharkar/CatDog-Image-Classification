## Overview

CatDog-Image-Classification is a machine learning project that aims to classify images into two categories: cats and dogs. The project utilizes deep learning techniques to create a model that can distinguish between images of cats and dogs accurately.

## Features

- **Image Classification**: The model can classify images into two classes: cats and dogs.
- **Accuracy**: The model is trained on a dataset of cat and dog images to ensure high accuracy in classification.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: You can explore the model training process and evaluation in the provided Jupyter Notebook.
- **Test Images**: Sample cat and dog images are included in the repository for testing the trained model.

## Getting Started

To get started with the CatDog-Image-Classification project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dishantkharkar/CatDog-Image-Classification.git
   ```

2. Open and explore the Jupyter Notebook `CatDog_Image_Classification.ipynb` to understand the model training process.

3. Use the model to classify images of cats and dogs using the provided test images (`cat.jpg` and `dog.jpg`).

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model is available in the `https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salader/dogs-vs-cats`. It contains a collection of labeled cat and dog images.
